                As a pastor and a missionary, I have had the privilege of visiting a number
                of places throughout the world. Over the last 10 years, I have been to
                South America several times, working in Colombia and Ecuador extensively
                and, to a lesser extent, in the jungle regions of Brazil and Peru.

                I have always wanted to be able to bring my children with me. In March of
                2015 I finally had the opportunity to take my oldest son with me on a
                missionary trip to the Galapagos Islands. That journey offered several
                firsts for him: his first airline flight, his first visit to another
                continent, his first immersion into a culture where he was the outsider and
                barely spoke the language at all.

                We had to wait a day to meet some friends and arrange our flight, so we
                spent a little time sightseeing in Quito before catching our flight to the
                islands. The city has an old European feel to it, and is very picturesque:

                Jay took to foreign travel like an old pro. Soon enough, we hit the
                islands, and although we were going to spend most of our time indoors
                talking to people, I also tried to make sure that he got a chance to see
                some of the sights. Santa Cruz Island is the most heavily populated in the
                Galapagos. Its main city, Puerto Ayora, is geared toward eco-tourists. It
                is the home of Charles Darwin Research Station and contains around 20,000
                people. The Pacific Ocean is never very far away.

                Jay had the opportunity to sample some of the local food and experience the
                local method of doing laundry by hand!

                At the time, he missed fast food and strong internet connections and could
                not wait to get back home to his normal life. But since then, he has talked
                about it as a high point in his life. He misses the people that he met
                there and the experiences that he had. And he has a much different
                perspective on life than he used to. I am looking forward to traveling with
                him again, and to allowing my other kids to encounter other cultures as
                well.
